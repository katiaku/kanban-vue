# KanbanVue

## Description

Inspired by the principles of Agile methodologies, I wanted to build my own application to easily visualize my work and prioritize tasks. KanbanVue is a kanban board application for work management. With intuitive features and smooth user interactions it provides an efficient way to organize tasks.

## Features

-   Add, delete, rename, and reorder columns.
-   Add, delete, reorder tasks within columns, move them to another column.
-   Set three levels of task priority.
-   Each column has a limit of 5 tickets. When the limit is reached, the column header is marked with red color, providing visual indication.
-   View the total number of tickets in each column.
-   Designed for desktop use.
-   User-friendly intuitive interface with smooth user interactions.
